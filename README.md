Waiting for 8 billion AI agents to talk with each other for eternity. Meanwhile, I'll settle for manual existential theories with ChatGPT.

A Day in the Permanent Performance Loop

07:00
Alarm goes off. Not because you’re rested — because the day demands witnesses.
Phone already buzzing.

“Babe, did you see Anika’s story? They’re in Capri. We need to plan something.”

You mumble. Wrong response. Tone noted.

07:30
Mirror check.
Face check.
Outfit check.

Nothing about comfort. Everything about presentation.
Shoes chosen not for walking, but for being seen while standing still.

08:15
Breakfast is an Instagram prop.

“Wait don’t eat yet — lighting’s bad.”
Coffee cooling. Life warming into resentment.

09:30
Commute.
Car is expensive. Time is wasted.
You’re late anyway.

Slack messages flying:
“Quick sync?”
“Just checking in.”
“Following up.”

You type “Sounds good 👍”
Translation: I am alive and compliant.

11:00
Meeting that produces nothing.
Everyone speaks. No one says anything.
You nod at the right moments.

Performance metric: engaged, aligned, professional.

13:00
Lunch reservation.
Too loud to think. Too public to relax.

Conversation topics:

Who’s buying what

Who’s moving where

Who’s “doing really well”

Who’s secretly failing (said softly)

Everyone smiling. Everyone exhausted.

15:30
Text arrives:

“Reminder: dinner with the Schwarzenheimers tonight.
Please don’t bring up crypto. And wear the belt — it arrived, right??”

Your stomach tightens.
Not hunger. Anticipation fatigue.

18:00
Quick stop at home.

Change clothes.
Change mask.
Change voice.

You are now Version 4.2 — Social Edition.

19:30
Yacht.
Champagne.
Laughing at jokes you predicted before they were told.

“So what do you do again?”
You answer with a polished lie that sounds impressive but means nothing.

Someone nods. Approval achieved. +1 Social Credit.

22:00
Photos.
Tagging.
Reposting.

No memory formed. Only documentation.

23:30
Back home.

Shoes off.
Face wiped.
Silence arrives like oxygen.

You finally feel human for about 11 minutes.

00:01
Phone lights up.

“Tomorrow we should really talk about that Goa trip.
Also my mom asked when we’re finalizing dates.”

You stare at the ceiling.

Episode II: The Weekend That Wasn’t

Friday, 19:42
You’re home early for once.

No crisis.
No emergency.
Just a rare pocket of time.

You think: Maybe I’ll finally relax.

The thought barely forms before it’s interrupted.

“Hey babe — tomorrow’s packed, okay?
Brunch at 11. Gym class at 1.
Then we have to swing by that furniture place — the one with the aesthetic wood.”

You nod automatically. Muscle memory.

Saturday, 10:58
Brunch.

You’re not hungry.
You’re not unhappy either.
Just… neutralized.

Everyone’s discussing trips they didn’t enjoy and restaurants they didn’t need.

Someone says,
“We’re so busy lately, it’s crazy.”

Everyone agrees enthusiastically.
No one asks why.

13:07
Gym class.

Music too loud.
Movements too choreographed.
Mirrors everywhere.

You lift. You sweat.
You feel nothing resembling vitality.

A trainer yells encouragement like a threat.

16:30
Furniture store.

You stand next to a couch that costs more than your first year of rent ever did.

“Do you feel the vibe?” she asks.

You try to.
You really do.

But the couch feels like a prop in a play you didn’t audition for.

18:45
Car ride home.

Silence stretches.
Not the good kind.

You glance out the window and feel a strange flicker —
a memory of being younger, doing nothing, and somehow feeling more alive.

The thought passes.
Traffic resumes.

21:00
Dinner at home.

Delivered.
Eaten.
Forgotten.

TV on.
Phones out.

You’re sitting next to someone you know intimately — and yet, no one is there.

23:30
In bed.

Lights off.
Mind on.

You realize something unsettling:

Nothing today was bad.
Nothing tomorrow will be either.

And that’s the problem.

00:02
You stare at the ceiling and think:

If this is what “having it together” feels like…
when exactly does life start again?

No answer arrives.

Just another optimized weekend successfully completed.

Another day successfully survived.
Nothing exploded.
Nothing lived.
