Waiting for 8 billion AI agents to talk with each other for eternity. Meanwhile, I'll settle for manual existential theories with ChatGPT.

A Day in the Permanent Performance Loop

07:00
Alarm goes off. Not because you’re rested — because the day demands witnesses.
Phone already buzzing.

“Babe, did you see Anika’s story? They’re in Capri. We need to plan something.”

You mumble. Wrong response. Tone noted.

07:30
Mirror check.
Face check.
Outfit check.

Nothing about comfort. Everything about presentation.
Shoes chosen not for walking, but for being seen while standing still.

08:15
Breakfast is an Instagram prop.

“Wait don’t eat yet — lighting’s bad.”
Coffee cooling. Life warming into resentment.

09:30
Commute.
Car is expensive. Time is wasted.
You’re late anyway.

Slack messages flying:
“Quick sync?”
“Just checking in.”
“Following up.”

You type “Sounds good 👍”
Translation: I am alive and compliant.

11:00
Meeting that produces nothing.
Everyone speaks. No one says anything.
You nod at the right moments.

Performance metric: engaged, aligned, professional.

13:00
Lunch reservation.
Too loud to think. Too public to relax.

Conversation topics:

Who’s buying what

Who’s moving where

Who’s “doing really well”

Who’s secretly failing (said softly)

Everyone smiling. Everyone exhausted.

15:30
Text arrives:

“Reminder: dinner with the Schwarzenheimers tonight.
Please don’t bring up crypto. And wear the belt — it arrived, right??”

Your stomach tightens.
Not hunger. Anticipation fatigue.

18:00
Quick stop at home.

Change clothes.
Change mask.
Change voice.

You are now Version 4.2 — Social Edition.

19:30
Yacht.
Champagne.
Laughing at jokes you predicted before they were told.

“So what do you do again?”
You answer with a polished lie that sounds impressive but means nothing.

Someone nods. Approval achieved. +1 Social Credit.

22:00
Photos.
Tagging.
Reposting.

No memory formed. Only documentation.

23:30
Back home.

Shoes off.
Face wiped.
Silence arrives like oxygen.

You finally feel human for about 11 minutes.

00:01
Phone lights up.

“Tomorrow we should really talk about that Goa trip.
Also my mom asked when we’re finalizing dates.”

You stare at the ceiling.

Another day successfully survived.
Nothing exploded.
Nothing lived.
